# Contributing to Terrene
As an open-source project, Terrene welcomes contributions of many forms.

## Bug Reports

We appreciate your effort to improve Terrene by submitting a bug report. Before doing so, please check the following things:

1. Check whether the bug you face hasn't been already reported. Duplicate reports take us time, that we could be used to fix other bugs or make improvements.

2. If you got an error, please describe what happened. Reports like "I get an error when I clicked on some link" are not very helpful. In order to fix any issues encountered, we need details.

3. Provide easy steps to reproduce.

Thanks for your help!

## Picking a Github Issue#
We encourage you to start with an issue labeled with the tag good first issue on the Github issue board, to get familiar with our codebase as a first-time contributor.

You can also explore other labels and pick any issue based on your interest.

## Submit Your Code#
To submit your code, fork the Terrene repository, create a new branch on your fork, and open a Pull Request (PR) once your work is ready for review.

In the PR template, please describe the change, including the motivation/context, test coverage, and any other relevant information.

A core reviewer will review your PR in around one business day and provide feedback on any changes it requires to be approved. Once approved and all the tests pass, the reviewer will click the Squash and merge button in Github.
